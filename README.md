# Project Idea

This project aims to build a smart locker. Depending on who approaches the box, the system will react differently:
- Owner of the box --> automatically open
- Intruder(Preinputted into the database and recognized by the owner as hostile) --> the system will 1)send a notification to the user via a mobile app that 911 has been called and 2)light up a red alarm light. 
- Stranger --> the mobile app will send a picture from the camera on the smart locker to the user and ask the user if they want to give permission to this stranger to open the locker
