# Project Idea

This project aims to build a smart locker. Depending on who approaches the box, the system will react differently:
- Owner of the box --> automatically open
- Intruder(Preinputted into the database and recognized by the owner as hostile) --> the system will 1)send a notification to the user via a mobile app that 911 has been called and 2)light up a red alarm light. 
- Stranger --> the mobile app will send a picture from the camera on the smart locker to the user and ask the user if they want to give permission to this stranger to open the locker

## Rough form: this is your paper prototype (put photos on your GitHub, bring the actual thing to class)

## Used Parts: is there a display, a motor, batters, interface, etc? Where does the Pi/Arduino/other controller go?

* camera
* crystal display
* arduino
* raspberry pi
* LED light(red)
* cardboard box

The Pi and arduino will go inside a physical incasing(box) with a button (attached to the arduino) and a camera (attached to the Pi) exposed on the top of the box.
